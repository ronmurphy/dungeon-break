# Dungeon Break: Rules & Mechanics

## ⚔️ Combat System: The Clash
Combat in Dungeon Break is fast, visceral, and dangerous. Unlike traditional RPGs where you take turns swinging at static targets, every attack is a **Clash**.

### 1. The Engagement
When you encounter an enemy in the dungeon, you are transported to a **Battle Island**—a pocket dimension representing the conflict.
- **Initiative:** Currently, the player acts first by choosing an action from the Command Menu.
 - **Positioning:** Movement is restricted by your speed.
   - **Standard:** 30 ft (6 units).
   - **Strider/Scoundrel:** 40 ft (8 units).
   - A green circle indicates your remaining movement range for the turn.

### 2. The Clash Mechanic (Simultaneous Rolls)
When you attack, you don't just roll to hit; you roll to **overpower**.
1.  **Power Calculation:**
    *   **Player Power:** `Strength + Weapon Value`
    *   **Enemy Power:** `Strength + Weapon Value` (Base 4 for generic enemies)
2.  **Die Selection:** Your Power determines the physical die you roll.
    *   Power 1-4: **d4**
    *   Power 5-6: **d6**
    *   Power 7-8: **d8**
    *   Power 9-10: **d10**
    *   Power 11-12: **d12**
    *   Power 13+: **d20** (+ Bonus for excess power)
3.  **The Roll:** Both you and the enemy roll simultaneously.
4.  **Resolution:**
    *   **Winner:** The side with the higher total roll wins the clash.
    *   **Damage:** `Winner's Roll - Loser's Armor Class (AC)`.
    *   **Tie:** A "Clash" occurs. No damage is dealt, sparks fly.

### 3. Flanking & Surprise Attacks
- If you initiate combat by approaching an enemy from behind (outside their cone of vision), your first attack in that combat is a **Flank Attack**.
- A Flank Attack deals **1.5x damage**, rounded up.

note: The Scoundrel, Stalker and Minstrel use Dexterity and not Strength for Player Power.
      If a player has no weapons equipped, their weapon value becomes 1.

### 4. Defense & Armor
Armor doesn't make you harder to hit; it **absorbs damage**.
- **AC (Armor Class):** Directly subtracts from incoming damage.
- **Strategy:** Heavy armor is vital against hard-hitting enemies (high die sizes), while high Strength lets you punch through enemy armor.

## 🛡️ Stats & Attributes
The game uses a simplified "Single Digit" attribute system (Point Buy).

- **STR (Strength):** Determines your **Die Size** in combat. Higher STR = Bigger Dice.
- **DEX (Dexterity):** Affects movement speed and dodge chance.
- **INT (Intelligence):** Boosts spell effects and item usage.
- **LCK (Luck):** Affects critical hit chance and loot quality.

## 🎒 Equipment
- **Weapons:** Add directly to your Power. A rusty sword (2) is better than fists (0), but a Greatsword (6) turns you into a powerhouse.
- **Armor:** Increases your AC.
- **Potions:** Restore HP instantly.
- **Artifacts:** Passive bonuses (e.g., Lanterns for light, Rings for stats).

## 🕯️ Exploration
- **The Torch:** Your lifeline. It burns fuel as you move. If it goes out, you are lost in the dark.
- **Bonfires:** Restore HP and Torch Fuel.
- **Merchants:** Trade Soul Coins for equipment.
- **Wanderers:** Enemies roam the map. They have a vision cone and will chase you if spotted. Touching them triggers combat.
